Description: An S4 representation of the Command design pattern. The
  Operation class is a simple implementation using closures and supports
  forward and reverse (undo) evaluation. The more complicated Protocol
  framework represents each type of command (or analytical protocol) by
  a formal S4 class. Commands may be grouped and consecutively executed
  using the Pipeline class. Example use cases include logging, do/undo,
  analysis pipelines, GUI actions, parallel processing, etc.
